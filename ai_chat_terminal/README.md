# AI Chat Terminal (Gleam)

This is a simple AI chat terminal application built with Gleam.

## Prerequisites

- Gleam (ensure it's installed and in your PATH, e.g., via asdf: `asdf install gleam latest && asdf global gleam latest`)

## Building the Project

The `gleam run` command will typically handle compilation automatically. However, if you want to build separately, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
gleam build
```

## Running the Application

To compile and run the application:

```bash
gleam run
```

Once running, type your messages and press Enter. The AI (currently a placeholder) will respond.
Type `quit` or press `Ctrl+D` to exit.

## Running Tests

The project currently has a default test. To run tests:

```bash
gleam test
```
